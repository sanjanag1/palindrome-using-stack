# palindrome-using-stack
use stack to recognize palindromes. Palindromes are strings that read the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam"). Use getline() to read the whole string, push each character into the stack (to reverse the string), then compare the reversed string to the original one. Note that you must use stack for string reversing.
